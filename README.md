# Map-Application

A simple Map-Application (purely object oriented) which will find your current location and,

1. we will be able to set locations on map depending upon the workout we want to have on that location and will be able to set it.
2. we will be able to store our all workout records on local storage along with locations
   (NOTE: if you want to clear previously stored workout records, just go to console and type :=> app.reset())
3. we will be able to render on location of particular workout on map after clicking on any workout record
